        French press coffee is dense and heavy, yet it has its own sort of elegance.
        As with any method, the devil is in the details: To achieve a full expression of the coffee, decant it immediately after brewing so it doesnâ€™t become bitter or chalky.
        Then, sink into this rich and heady cup. It only takes four minutes to brew.
